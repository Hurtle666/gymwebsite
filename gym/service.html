    </div>
    <p id="talks">At HTG-Gym_Club, we understand that life can get busy and tiring. That is why we have so many different classes available to you from sun rise to sun set. In the recent years, yoga has gained a huge following and has increased in popularity. Many people are starting to practice yoga and are seeing the great physical and mental benefits. Yoga practice is a great way to strengthen the bond between your mind and your body. It is also a great way to learn to appreciate your body and its abilities. Our bodies carry us throughout the day, and yoga is about creating the opportunity to focus on our breathing, stretching and developing mindfulness...</p>
    <p id="talks">A simple yoga practice can increase your levels of concentration, alleviate symptoms of anxiety, help you sleep better at time, and over time, regain mobility, flexibility and range of motion. As yoga does not discriminate, all levels are invited to practice. Whether it is your first time, or your 100th, your experience will be just as freeing, and calming. With the room temperature slightly warmer, your body will begin relaxing the moment you enter the room and the energy from the class will make you feel free and at ease. Klub 20 yoga classes are designed for all levels of abilities and the instructors are trained to adapt your practice to optimize your experience so that you are comfortable and respecting your body. Our membership includes all group classes at Klub 20. If you are interested in adding yoga to your lifestyle, simply select a class, bring a mat and enjoy. Namaste...</p>
