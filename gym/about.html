        <strong>

            Instead of being just another gym equipment retailer, our founders wanted to be the best in the industry and set their minds to doing so! Over the last two decades Gym and Fitness has grown into one of Australia’s largest online fitness equipment retailers, helping thousands of customers live longer, happier and healthier lives.</strong>
